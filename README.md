## Problem with validate() method

Hello, I changed the code because the "validate.()" method was not validating the data, so it printed the else: "card not found." What I did was pass parameters directly to each class and did not choose to inherit them between the parent class and the child class. I am sharing the code in case this happens to anyone, I added some extra code to make it a little more interactive.
